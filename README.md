# Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Preprocessing, and Classification Model Building

Welcome to the course project on Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Preprocessing, and Classification Model Building! This project will provide you with hands-on experience in understanding, cleaning, and preprocessing data, as well as building and fine-tuning classification models. These skills are fundamental in the field of machine learning and data analysis.

## Dataset Description

In this project, you will be working with a dataset that contains information related to healthcare and patient records. The dataset comprises the following columns:

1. **index**: A unique identifier for each record.
2. **Health Service Area**: The geographical area related to health services.
3. **Hospital County**: The county where the hospital is located.
4. **Operating Certificate Number**: A certification number for the hospital's operation.
5. **Facility ID**: A unique identifier for healthcare facilities.
6. **Facility Name**: The name of the healthcare facility.
7. **Age Group**: The age group of the patient.
8. **Zip Code - 3 digits**: The first three digits of the patient's zip code.
9. **Gender**: The patient's gender.
10. **Race**: The patient's race.
11. **Ethnicity**: The patient's ethnicity.
12. **Length of Stay**: The duration of the patient's stay in the hospital.
13. **Type of Admission**: The type of admission (e.g., elective, emergency).
14. **Patient Disposition**: Where the patient went after leaving the hospital.
15. **Discharge Year**: The year when the patient was discharged.
16. **CCS Diagnosis Code**: Diagnosis code using the Clinical Classifications Software.
17. **CCS Diagnosis Description**: Description of the diagnosis.
18. **CCS Procedure Code**: Procedure code using the Clinical Classifications Software.
19. **CCS Procedure Description**: Description of the procedure.
20. **APR DRG Code**: Code for the All Patients Refined Diagnosis Related Group.
21. **APR DRG Description**: Description of the APR DRG.
22. **APR MDC Code**: Code for the APR Medical Diagnostic Category.
23. **APR MDC Description**: Description of the APR MDC.
24. **APR Severity of Illness Code**: Code for the severity of illness.
25. **APR Severity of Illness Description**: Description of the severity of illness.
26. **APR Risk of Mortality**: Risk of mortality associated with the patient's condition.
27. **APR Medical Surgical Description**: Description of whether the treatment was medical or surgical.
28. **Source of Payment 1**: The primary source of payment.
29. **Source of Payment 2**: The secondary source of payment.
30. **Source of Payment 3**: The tertiary source of payment.
31. **Attending Provider License Number**: License number of the attending provider.
32. **Operating Provider License Number**: License number of the operating provider.
33. **Other Provider License Number**: License number of other healthcare providers.
34. **Birth Weight**: The birth weight of the patient (if applicable).
35. **Abortion Edit Indicator**: Indicator for abortion-related cases.
36. **Emergency Department Indicator**: Indicator for cases related to the emergency department.
37. **Total Charges**: Total charges for healthcare services.
38. **Total Costs**: Total costs incurred for healthcare services.

## Project Overview

In this course project, we have perform the following tasks:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: We have analyze the dataset to gain insights into the data, identify patterns, and understand the distribution of variables.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: We have clean and preprocess the data to prepare it for machine learning. This may involve handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

3. **Classification Model Building**: We have build, train, and fine-tune classification models based on the dataset. The goal is to predict a specific target variable, which will be defined in the project instructions.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine.
2. Download the dataset provided and place it in the project directory.
3. Open your preferred programming environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook) and start working on the project.

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following Python libraries and packages installed:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

You can install these libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
python classification.ipynb
```

## Project Structure

The project repository is structured as follows:

- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for performing EDA, data preprocessing, and model building.
- `results/`: Directory to store model evaluation results and reports.
- `README.md`: This README file.
